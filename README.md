# French-Political-Games
French political games created by official political parties in France.

All of the HTML5-based games are standalone and can work offline.

# Fiscal Kombat (2017 version)

This was the original release released back in 2017 by "La France insoumise" (Unsubmissive France).

I also provided a rough english translation (index-en.html) with it.

Later, a 2019 variant of the game was created for the European elections with a different protagonist. (That variant later got a Godot-based Android port)


# Super Jam Bros

This was a platformer game created by AdAsGame for "La Republique En marche" (Republic Forward).

According to newspapers, around 5000~10000â‚¬ were spent for the creation of the game.

Unlike Fiscal Kombat, this requires WebGL and was created with GDevelop.
